# Due to reasons [1], the old python2 matrix-synapse package will not stop the
# service when the package is uninstalled. Our maintainer scripts will do the
# right thing in terms of ensuring the service is enabled and unmasked, but
# then do a `systemctl start matrix-synapse`, which of course does nothing -
# leaving the old (py2) service running.
#
# There should normally be no reason for the service to be running during our
# preinst, so we assume that if it *is* running, it's due to that situation,
# and stop it.
#
# [1] dh_systemd_start doesn't do anything because it sees that there is an
#     init.d script with the same name, so leaves it to dh_installinit.
#
#     dh_installinit doesn't do anything because somebody gave it a --no-start
#     for unknown reasons.
