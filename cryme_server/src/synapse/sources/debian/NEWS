matrix-synapse-py3 (0.34.0) stable; urgency=medium

  matrix-synapse-py3 is intended as a drop-in replacement for the existing
  matrix-synapse package. When the package is installed, matrix-synapse will be
  automatically uninstalled. The replacement should be relatively seamless,
  however, please note the following important differences to matrix-synapse:

  * Most importantly, the matrix-synapse service now runs under Python 3 rather
    than Python 2.7.

  * Synapse is installed into its own virtualenv (in /opt/venvs/matrix-synapse)
    instead of using the system python libraries. (This may mean that you can
    remove a number of old dependencies with `apt autoremove`).

  * If you have previously manually installed any custom python extensions
    (such as matrix-synapse-rest-auth) into the system python directories, you
    will need to reinstall them in the new virtualenv. Please consult the
    documentation of the relevant extensions for further details.

  matrix-synapse-py3 will take over responsibility for the existing
  configuration files, including the matrix-synapse systemd service.

  Beware, however, that `apt purge matrix-synapse` will *disable* the
  matrix-synapse service (so that it will not be started on reboot), even
  though that service is no longer being provided by the matrix-synapse
  package. It can be re-enabled with `systemctl enable matrix-synapse`.

  The matrix.org team will continue to provide Python 2 `matrix-synapse`
  packages for the next couple of releases, to allow time for system
  administrators to test the new packages.
