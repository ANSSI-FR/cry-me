synctl(1) -- Synapse server control interface
=============================================

## SYNOPSIS
  Start, stop or restart synapse server.

`synctl` {start|stop|restart} [configfile] [-w|--worker=<WORKERCONFIG>] [-a|--all-processes=<WORKERCONFIGDIR>]

## DESCRIPTION

**synctl** can be used to start, stop or restart Synapse server.  The
control operation can be done on all processes or a single worker
process.

## OPTIONS

  * `action`:
    The value of action should be one of `start`, `stop` or `restart`.

  * `configfile`:
    Optional path of the configuration file to use.  Default value is
    `homeserver.yaml`.  The configuration file must exist for the
    operation to succeed.

  * `-w`, `--worker`:

    Perform start, stop or restart operations on a single worker.
    Incompatible with `-a`|`--all-processes`.  Value passed must be a
    valid worker's configuration file.

  * `-a`, `--all-processes`:

    Perform start, stop or restart operations on all the workers in
    the given directory and the main synapse process. Incompatible
    with `-w`|`--worker`.  Value passed must be a directory containing
    valid work configuration files.  All files ending with `.yaml`
    extension shall be considered as configuration files and all other
    files in the directory are ignored.

## CONFIGURATION FILE

Configuration file may be generated as follows:

    $ python -m synapse.app.homeserver -c config.yaml --generate-config --server-name=<server name>

## ENVIRONMENT

  * `SYNAPSE_CACHE_FACTOR`:
    Synapse's architecture is quite RAM hungry currently - we deliberately
    cache a lot of recent room data and metadata in RAM in order to speed up
    common requests. We'll improve this in the future, but for now the easiest
    way to either reduce the RAM usage (at the risk of slowing things down)
    is to set the almost-undocumented ``SYNAPSE_CACHE_FACTOR`` environment
    variable. The default is 0.5, which can be decreased to reduce RAM usage
    in memory constrained enviroments, or increased if performance starts to
    degrade.

    However, degraded performance due to a low cache factor, common on
    machines with slow disks, often leads to explosions in memory use due
    backlogged requests. In this case, reducing the cache factor will make
    things worse. Instead, try increasing it drastically. 2.0 is a good
    starting value.
