    """A wrapper for asynchronous calls whose results should be shared

    This is useful for wrapping asynchronous functions, where there might be multiple
    callers, but we only want to call the underlying function once (and have the result
    returned to all callers).

    Similar results can be achieved via a lock of some form, but that typically requires
    more boilerplate (and ends up being less efficient).

    Correctly handles Synapse logcontexts (logs and resource usage for the underlying
    function are logged against the logcontext which is active when get() is first
    called).

    Example usage:

        _cached_val = CachedCall(_load_prop)

        async def handle_request() -> X:
            # We can call this multiple times, but it will result in a single call to
            # _load_prop().
            return await _cached_val.get()

        async def _load_prop() -> X:
            await difficult_operation()


    The implementation is deliberately single-shot (ie, once the call is initiated,
    there is no way to ask for it to be run). This keeps the implementation and
    semantics simple. If you want to make a new call, simply replace the whole
    CachedCall object.
