"""
Main purpose of this upgrade is to change the unique key on the
pushers table again (it was missed when the v16 full schema was
made) but this also changes the pushkey and data columns to text.
When selecting a bytea column into a text column, postgres inserts
the hex encoded data, and there's no portable way of getting the
UTF-8 bytes, so we have to do it in Python.
