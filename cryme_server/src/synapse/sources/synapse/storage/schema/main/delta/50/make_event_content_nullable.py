We want to stop populating 'event.content', so we need to make it nullable.

If this has to be rolled back, then the following should populate the missing data:

Postgres:

    UPDATE events SET content=(ej.json::json)->'content' FROM event_json ej
    WHERE ej.event_id = events.event_id AND
        stream_ordering < (
            SELECT stream_ordering FROM events WHERE content IS NOT NULL
            ORDER BY stream_ordering LIMIT 1
        );

    UPDATE events SET content=(ej.json::json)->'content' FROM event_json ej
    WHERE ej.event_id = events.event_id AND
        stream_ordering > (
            SELECT stream_ordering FROM events WHERE content IS NOT NULL
            ORDER BY stream_ordering DESC LIMIT 1
        );

SQLite:

    UPDATE events SET content=(
        SELECT json_extract(json,'$.content') FROM event_json ej
        WHERE ej.event_id = events.event_id
    )
    WHERE
        stream_ordering < (
            SELECT stream_ordering FROM events WHERE content IS NOT NULL
            ORDER BY stream_ordering LIMIT 1
        )
        OR stream_ordering > (
            SELECT stream_ordering FROM events WHERE content IS NOT NULL
            ORDER BY stream_ordering DESC LIMIT 1
        );
