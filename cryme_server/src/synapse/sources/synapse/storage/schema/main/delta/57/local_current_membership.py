# We create a new table called `local_current_membership` that stores the latest
# membership state of local users in rooms, which helps track leaves/bans/etc
# even if the server has left the room (and so has deleted the room from
# `current_state_events`). This will also include outstanding invites for local
# users for rooms the server isn't in.
#
# If the server isn't and hasn't been in the room then it will only include
# outsstanding invites, and not e.g. pre-emptive bans of local users.
#
# If the server later rejoins a room `local_current_membership` can simply be
# replaced with the new current state of the room (which results in the
# equivalent behaviour as if the server had remained in the room).
