class StateStore(StateGroupWorkerStore, MainStateBackgroundUpdateStore):
    """Keeps track of the state at a given event.

    This is done by the concept of `state groups`. Every event is a assigned
    a state group (identified by an arbitrary string), which references a
    collection of state events. The current state of an event is then the
    collection of state events referenced by the event's state group.

    Hence, every change in the current state causes a new state group to be
    generated. However, if no change happens (e.g., if we get a message event
    with only one parent it inherits the state group from its parent.)

    There are three tables:
      * `state_groups`: Stores group name, first event with in the group and
        room id.
      * `event_to_state_groups`: Maps events to state groups.
      * `state_groups_state`: Maps state group to state events.
