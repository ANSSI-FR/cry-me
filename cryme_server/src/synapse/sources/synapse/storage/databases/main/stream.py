""" This module is responsible for getting events from the DB for pagination
and event streaming.

The order it returns events in depend on whether we are streaming forwards or
are paginating backwards. We do this because we want to handle out of order
messages nicely, while still returning them in the correct order when we
paginate bacwards.

This is implemented by keeping two ordering columns: stream_ordering and
topological_ordering. Stream ordering is basically insertion/received order
(except for events from backfill requests). The topological_ordering is a
weak ordering of events based on the pdu graph.

This means that we have to have two different types of tokens, depending on
what sort order was used:
    - stream tokens are of the form: "s%d", which maps directly to the column
    - topological tokems: "t%d-%d", where the integers map to the topological
      and stream ordering columns respectively.
