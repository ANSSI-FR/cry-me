Postgres sequence '%(seq)s' is inconsistent with associated

To fix this error, shut down Synapse (including any and all workers)
and run the following SQL:

    SELECT setval('%(seq)s', (
        %(max_id_sql)s
    ));

See docs/postgres.md for more information.

Postgres sequence '%(seq)s' is inconsistent with associated stream position
of '%(stream_name)s' in the 'stream_positions' table.

This is likely a programming error and should be reported at
https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse.

A temporary workaround to fix this error is to shut down Synapse (including
any and all workers) and run the following SQL:

    DELETE FROM stream_positions WHERE stream_name = '%(stream_name)s';

This will need to be done every time the server is restarted.
