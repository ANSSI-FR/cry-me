    API endpoint which can insert a batch of events historically back in time
    next to the given `prev_event`.

    `batch_id` comes from `next_batch_id `in the response of the batch send
    endpoint and is derived from the "insertion" events added to each batch.
    It's not required for the first batch send.

    `state_events_at_start` is used to define the historical state events
    needed to auth the events like join events. These events will float
    outside of the normal DAG as outlier's and won't be visible in the chat
    history which also allows us to insert multiple batches without having a bunch
    of `@mxid joined the room` noise between each batch.

    `events` is chronological list of events you want to insert.
    There is a reverse-chronological constraint on batches so once you insert
    some messages, you can only insert older ones after that.
    tldr; Insert batches from your most recent history -> oldest history.
