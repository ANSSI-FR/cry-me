        proxy_reactor: twisted reactor to use for connections to the proxy server
                       reactor might have some blacklisting applied (i.e. for DNS queries),
                       but we need unblocked access to the proxy.

        contextFactory: A factory for TLS contexts, to control the
            verification parameters of OpenSSL.  The default is to use a
            `BrowserLikePolicyForHTTPS`, so unless you have special
            requirements you can leave this as-is.

        connectTimeout: The amount of time that this Agent will wait
            for the peer to accept a connection, in seconds. If 'None',
            HostnameEndpoint's default (30s) will be used.
            This is used for connections to both proxies and destination servers.

        bindAddress: The local address for client sockets to bind to.

        pool: connection pool to be used. If None, a
            non-persistent pool instance will be created.

        use_proxy: Whether proxy settings should be discovered and used
            from conventional environment variables.

    Raises:
        ValueError if use_proxy is set and the environment variables
            contain an invalid proxy specification.
