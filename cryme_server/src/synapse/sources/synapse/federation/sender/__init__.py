        # Some background on the rate-limiting going on here.
        #
        # It turns out that if we attempt to send out RRs as soon as we get them from
        # a client, then we end up trying to do several hundred Hz of federation
        # transactions. (The number of transactions scales as O(N^2) on the size of a
        # room, since in a large room we have both more RRs coming in, and more servers
        # to send them to.)
        #
        # This leads to a lot of CPU load, and we end up getting behind. The solution
        # currently adopted is as follows:
        #
        # The first receipt in a given room is sent out immediately, at time T0. Any
        # further receipts are, in theory, batched up for N seconds, where N is calculated
        # based on the number of servers in the room to achieve a transaction frequency
        # of around 50Hz. So, for example, if there were 100 servers in the room, then
        # N would be 100 / 50Hz = 2 seconds.
        #
        # Then, after T+N, we flush out any receipts that have accumulated, and restart
        # the timer to flush out more receipts at T+2N, etc. If no receipts accumulate,
        # we stop the cycle and go back to the start.
        #
        # However, in practice, it is often possible to flush out receipts earlier: in
        # particular, if we are sending a transaction to a given server anyway (for
        # example, because we have a PDU or a RR in another room to send), then we may
        # as well send out all of the pending RRs for that server. So it may be that
        # by the time we get to T+N, we don't actually have any RRs left to send out.
        # Nevertheless we continue to buffer up RRs for the room in question until we
        # reach the point that no RRs arrive between timer ticks.
        #
        # For even more background, see https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/issues/4730.
