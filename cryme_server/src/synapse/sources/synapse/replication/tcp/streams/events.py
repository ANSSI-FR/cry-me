"""Handling of the 'events' replication stream

This stream contains rows of various types. Each row therefore contains a 'type'
identifier before the real data. For example::

    RDATA events batch ["state", ["!room:id", "m.type", "", "$event:id"]]
    RDATA events 12345 ["ev", ["$event:id", "!room:id", "m.type", null, null]]

An "ev" row is sent for each new event. The fields in the data part are:

 * The new event id
 * The room id for the event
 * The type of the new event
 * The state key of the event, for state events
 * The event id of an event which is redacted by this event.

A "state" row is sent whenever the "current state" in a room changes. The fields in the
data part are:

 * The room id for the state change
 * The event type of the state which has changed
 * The state_key of the state which has changed
 * The event id of the new state
