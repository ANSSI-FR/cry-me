"""This module contains the implementation of both the client and server
protocols.

The basic structure of the protocol is line based, where the initial word of
each line specifies the command. The rest of the line is parsed based on the
command. For example, the `RDATA` command is defined as::

    RDATA <stream_name> <token> <row_json>

(Note that `<row_json>` may contains spaces, but cannot contain newlines.)

Blank lines are ignored.

# Example

An example iteraction is shown below. Each line is prefixed with '>' or '<' to
indicate which side is sending, these are *not* included on the wire::

    * connection established *
