# NOTE
# This is a small wrapper around opentracing because opentracing is not currently
# packaged downstream (specifically debian). Since opentracing instrumentation is
# fairly invasive it was awkward to make it optional. As a result we opted to encapsulate
# all opentracing state in these methods which effectively noop if opentracing is
# not present. We should strongly consider encouraging the downstream distributers
# to package opentracing and making opentracing a full dependency. In order to facilitate
# this move the methods have work very similarly to opentracing's and it should only
# be a matter of few regexes to move over to opentracing's access patterns proper.

============================
Using OpenTracing in Synapse
============================

Python-specific tracing concepts are at https://opentracing.io/guides/python/.
Note that Synapse wraps OpenTracing in a small module (this one) in order to make the
OpenTracing dependency optional. That means that the access patterns are
different to those demonstrated in the OpenTracing guides. However, it is
still useful to know, especially if OpenTracing is included as a full dependency
in the future or if you are modifying this module.


OpenTracing is encapsulated so that
no span objects from OpenTracing are exposed in Synapse's code. This allows
OpenTracing to be easily disabled in Synapse and thereby have OpenTracing as
an optional dependency. This does however limit the number of modifiable spans
at any point in the code to one. From here out references to `opentracing`
in the code snippets refer to the Synapses module.
Most methods provided in the module have a direct correlation to those provided
by opentracing. Refer to docs there for a more in-depth documentation on some of
the args and methods.

Tracing
-------

In Synapse it is not possible to start a non-active span. Spans can be started
using the ``start_active_span`` method. This returns a scope (see
OpenTracing docs) which is a context manager that needs to be entered and
exited. This is usually done by using ``with``.

.. code-block:: python

   from synapse.logging.opentracing import start_active_span

   with start_active_span("operation name"):
       # Do something we want to tracer

Forgetting to enter or exit a scope will result in some mysterious and grievous log
context errors.

At anytime where there is an active span ``opentracing.set_tag`` can be used to
set a tag on the current active span.

Tracing functions
-----------------

Functions can be easily traced using decorators. The name of
the function becomes the operation name for the span.

.. code-block:: python

   from synapse.logging.opentracing import trace

   # Start a span using 'interesting_function' as the operation name
   @trace
   def interesting_function(*args, **kwargs):
       # Does all kinds of cool and expected things
       return something_usual_and_useful


Operation names can be explicitly set for a function by passing the
operation name to ``trace``

.. code-block:: python

   from synapse.logging.opentracing import trace

   @trace(opname="a_better_operation_name")
   def interesting_badly_named_function(*args, **kwargs):
       # Does all kinds of cool and expected things
       return something_usual_and_useful

Setting Tags
------------

To set a tag on the active span do

.. code-block:: python

   from synapse.logging.opentracing import set_tag

   set_tag(tag_name, tag_value)

There's a convenient decorator to tag all the args of the method. It uses
inspection in order to use the formal parameter names prefixed with 'ARG_' as
tag names. It uses kwarg names as tag names without the prefix.

.. code-block:: python

   from synapse.logging.opentracing import tag_args

   @tag_args
   def set_fates(clotho, lachesis, atropos, father="Zues", mother="Themis"):
       pass

   set_fates("the story", "the end", "the act")
   # This will have the following tags
   #  - ARG_clotho: "the story"
   #  - ARG_lachesis: "the end"
   #  - ARG_atropos: "the act"
   #  - father: "Zues"
   #  - mother: "Themis"

Contexts and carriers
---------------------

There are a selection of wrappers for injecting and extracting contexts from
carriers provided. Unfortunately OpenTracing's three context injection
techniques are not adequate for our inject of OpenTracing span-contexts into
Twisted's http headers, EDU contents and our database tables. Also note that
the binary encoding format mandated by OpenTracing is not actually implemented
by jaeger_client v4.0.0 - it will silently noop.
Please refer to the end of ``logging/opentracing.py`` for the available
injection and extraction methods.

Homeserver whitelisting
-----------------------

Most of the whitelist checks are encapsulated in the modules's injection
and extraction method but be aware that using custom carriers or crossing
unchartered waters will require the enforcement of the whitelist.
``logging/opentracing.py`` has a ``whitelisted_homeserver`` method which takes
in a destination and compares it to the whitelist.

Most injection methods take a 'destination' arg. The context will only be injected
if the destination matches the whitelist or the destination is None.

=======
Gotchas
=======

- Checking whitelists on span propagation
- Inserting pii
- Forgetting to enter or exit a scope
- Span source: make sure that the span you expect to be active across a
  function call really will be that one. Does the current function have more
  than one caller? Will all of those calling functions have be in a context
  with an active span?
