        # If this feature is enabled, Synapse will regularly look for and purge events
        # which are older than the room's maximum retention period. Synapse will also

          # 'm.room.retention' state event. Currently, the value of 'min_lifetime' doesn't
          # matter much because Synapse doesn't take it into account yet.
          #
          #default_policy:

          # 'm.room.retention' event in its state which contains a 'min_lifetime' or a
          # 'max_lifetime' that's out of these bounds, Synapse will cap the room's policy
          # to these limits when running purge jobs.

          # Server admins can define the settings of the background jobs purging the
          # events which lifetime has expired under the 'purge_jobs' section.
          #
          # If no configuration is provided, a single job will be set up to delete expired
          # events in every room daily.
          #
          # Each job's configuration defines which range of message lifetimes the job
          # takes care of. For example, if 'shortest_max_lifetime' is '2d' and
          # 'longest_max_lifetime' is '3d', the job will handle purging expired events in
          # rooms whose state defines a 'max_lifetime' that's both higher than 2 days, and
          # lower than or equal to 3 days. Both the minimum and the maximum value of a
          # range are optional, e.g. a job with no 'shortest_max_lifetime' and a
          # 'longest_max_lifetime' of '3d' will handle every room with a retention policy
          # which 'max_lifetime' is lower than or equal to three days.
          #
          # The rationale for this per-job configuration is that some rooms might have a
          # retention policy with a low 'max_lifetime', where history needs to be purged
          # of outdated messages on a more frequent basis than for the rest of the rooms
          # (e.g. every 12h), but not want that purge to be performed by a job that's
          # iterating over every room it knows, which could be heavy on the server.
          #
          # If any purge job is configured, it is strongly recommended to have at least
          # a single job with neither 'shortest_max_lifetime' nor 'longest_max_lifetime'
          # set, or one job without 'shortest_max_lifetime' and one job without
          # 'longest_max_lifetime' set. Otherwise some rooms might be ignored, even if
          # 'allowed_lifetime_min' and 'allowed_lifetime_max' are set, because capping a
          # room's policy to these values is done after the policies are retrieved from
          # Synapse's database (which is done using the range specified in a purge job's
          # configuration).
