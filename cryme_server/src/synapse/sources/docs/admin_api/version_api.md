# Version API

This API returns the running Synapse version and the Python version
on which Synapse is being run. This is useful when a Synapse instance
is behind a proxy that does not forward the 'Server' header (which also
contains Synapse version information).

The api is:

```
GET /_synapse/admin/v1/server_version
```

It returns a JSON body like the following:

```json
{
    "server_version": "0.99.2rc1 (b=develop, abcdef123)",
    "python_version": "3.6.8"
}
```
