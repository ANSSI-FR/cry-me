# This file is maintained as an up-to-date snapshot of the default
# homeserver.yaml configuration generated by Synapse.
#
# It is intended to act as a reference for the default configuration,
# helping admins keep track of new options and other changes, and compare
# their configs with the current default.  As such, many of the actual
# config values shown are placeholders.
#
# It is *not* intended to be copied and used as the basis for a real
# homeserver.yaml. Instead, if you are starting from scratch, please generate
# a fresh config using Synapse by following the instructions in
# https://matrix-org.github.io/synapse/latest/setup/installation.html.

# Configuration options that take a time period can be set using a number
# followed by a letter. Letters have the following meanings:
# s = second
# m = minute
# h = hour
# d = day
# w = week
# y = year
# For example, setting redaction_retention_period: 5m would remove redacted
# messages from the database after 5 minutes, rather than 5 months.
