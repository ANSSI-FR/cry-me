# This script reads environment variables and generates a shared Synapse worker,
# nginx and supervisord configs depending on the workers requested.
#
# The environment variables it reads are:
#   * SYNAPSE_SERVER_NAME: The desired server_name of the homeserver.
#   * SYNAPSE_REPORT_STATS: Whether to report stats.
#   * SYNAPSE_WORKER_TYPES: A comma separated list of worker names as specified in WORKER_CONFIG
#         below. Leave empty for no workers, or set to '*' for all possible workers.
#
# NOTE: According to Complement's ENTRYPOINT expectations for a homeserver image (as defined
# in the project's README), this script may be run multiple times, and functionality should
# continue to work if so.
