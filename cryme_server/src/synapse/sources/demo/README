DO NOT USE THESE DEMO SERVERS IN PRODUCTION

Requires you to have done:
    python setup.py develop


The demo start.sh will start three synapse servers on ports 8080, 8081 and 8082, with host names localhost:$port. This can be easily changed to `hostname`:$port in start.sh if required.

To enable the servers to communicate untrusted ssl certs are used. In order to do this the servers do not check the certs
and are configured in a highly insecure way. Do not use these configuration files in production.

stop.sh will stop the synapse servers and the webclient.

clean.sh will delete the databases and log files.

To start a completely new set of servers, run:

    ./demo/stop.sh; ./demo/clean.sh && ./demo/start.sh


Logs and sqlitedb will be stored in demo/808{0,1,2}.{log,db}



Also note that when joining a public room on a differnt HS via "#foo:bar.net", then you are (in the current impl) joining a room with room_id "foo". This means that it won't work if your HS already has a room with that name.
