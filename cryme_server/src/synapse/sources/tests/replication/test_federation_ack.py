        This test checks that the federation sender is correctly sending back
        FEDERATION_ACK messages. The test works by spinning up a federation_sender
        worker server, and then fishing out its ReplicationCommandHandler. We wire
        the RCH up to a mock connection (so that we can observe the command being sent)
        and then poke in an RDATA row.

        XXX: it might be nice to do this by pretending to be a synapse master worker
        (or a redis server), and having the worker connect to us via a mocked-up TCP
        transport, rather than assuming that the implementation has a
        ReplicationCommandHandler.
