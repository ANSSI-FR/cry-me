== Instructions for library publishing
Make sure that you have permissions to publish in Yubico's Sonatype group.

Make sure that you put your credentials into:

  > ~/.gradle/gradle.properties

Example gradle.properties:

  signing.gnupg.executable=gpg
  signing.gnupg.keyName=<your_gpg_key_id>
  sonatype.username=<your_username>
  sonatype.password=<your_password>

Make sure that you have the desired library version values in the top level

  > build.gradle

example:

  subprojects {
      version = '1.0.0-SNAPSHOT'
  }

Suffix -SNAPSHOT allows you to deploy different version on top of what was already deployed.


As a dry run, publish to your local Maven repository ($HOME/.m2/):

  ./gradlew publishToMavenLocal


Run this command in Terminal to push to Sonatype staging repository:

  ./gradlew publish

Publishing can also be done for a single module:

  ./gradlew modulename:publish

When publishing to Sonatype you will need to log in to the staging repo to close and release.
