== YubiKit Android Demo
This Android Demo app serves as a sample of how to use the various YubiKit
modules to connect to and exercise the functionality provided by them. Each
application module is represented in its own view in the app, and showcases some
basic functionality of each supported YubiKey application.


=== Running the app
To get started, simply clone the git repository, open it as a project in
Android Studio, and build and run it from there. Note that you will need a
supported YubiKey to be able to test the functionality.
