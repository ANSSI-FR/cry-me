/**
 * Some API endpoints require authentication that interacts with the user.
 * The homeserver may provide many different ways of authenticating, such as user/password auth, login via a social network (OAuth2),
 * login by confirming a token sent to their email address, etc.
 *
 * The process takes the form of one or more 'stages'.
 * At each stage the client submits a set of data for a given authentication type and awaits a response from the server,
 * which will either be a final success or a request to perform an additional stage.
 * This exchange continues until the final success.
 *
 * For each endpoint, a server offers one or more 'flows' that the client can use to authenticate itself.
 * Each flow comprises a series of stages, as described above.
 * The client is free to choose which flow it follows, however the flow's stages must be completed in order.
 * Failing to follow the flows in order must result in an HTTP 401 response.
 * When all stages in a flow are complete, authentication is complete and the API call succeeds.

     * When the API needs additional auth, this will be called.
     * Implementation should check the flows from flow response and act accordingly.
     * Updated auth should be provided using promise.resume, this allow implementation to perform
     * an async operation (prompt for user password, open sso fallback) and then resume initial API call when done.
